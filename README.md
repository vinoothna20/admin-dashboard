# admin-dashboard

This is a simple, responsive Admin Dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid. It is part of my learning journey from The Odin Project (TOP). The dashboard displays a sidebar with links, a header with user profile and navigation buttons, project cards, announcements, and trending topics.

### Features
**Sidebar Navigation:** Includes links to various sections like Home, Profile, Messages, Tasks, and more.

**Search Bar:** To search for content across the dashboard.

**User Profile and Notifications:** Display the current user's profile image and recent notifications.

**Project Cards:** Displays projects with status, description, and action icons.

**Announcements:** Displays important system updates or feature rollouts.

**Trending Section:** Lists trending topics and users.

### Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the structure and content.

CSS: Used for styling and layout. The dashboard is designed using CSS Grid to create a responsive, two-column layout.

Font Awesome: For adding scalable vector icons (e.g., icons for buttons and sidebar).
